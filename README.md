# HexMap
Utilities for storing and manipulating 2D and 3D hexagonal grids. Much of this library was made possible thanks to Amit Patel's work at [https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/). If you want to learn more about concepts such as Cubic coordinates or hex layouts please visit this page - it will help greatly with understanding this library (plus it is a masterclass in webpage design).


## TODO
- Seperate HexMap3D into HexMapCore
- Create HexMap.2D
- Add utilities for path finding, range finding, selection etc
- Add serialisation to save and load maps
